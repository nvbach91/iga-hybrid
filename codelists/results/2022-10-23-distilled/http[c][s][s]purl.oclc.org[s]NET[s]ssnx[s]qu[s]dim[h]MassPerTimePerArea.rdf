"Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets).  Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. "Dry aerosol" means aerosol without water. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  The sum of turbulent deposition and gravitational settling is dry deposition.</rdfs:comment>

	<rdfs:comment>The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. (The volume enclosed between the geoid and the sea floor equals the mean volume of water in the ocean.) In an ocean GCM the geoid is the surface of zero depth, or the rigid lid if the model uses that approximation. "Sea surface height" is a time-varying quantity. By definition of the geoid, the global average of the time-mean sea surface height (i.e. mean sea level) above the geoid must be zero. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above mean sea level is sea_surface_height_above_sea_level. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid is sea_surface_height_above_reference_ellipsoid.</rdfs:comment>

	<rdfs:comment> "Content" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  "Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for halon1301 is CBrF3. The IUPAC name for halon1301 is bromo-trifluoro-methane.</rdfs:comment>

For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  "Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for methane is CH4. Methane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes.  There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species.</rdfs:comment>

"Throughfall" is the part of the precipitation flux that reaches the ground directly through the vegetative canopy, through intershrub spaces in the canopy, and as drip from the leaves, twigs, and stems (but not including snowmelt).

	<rdfs:comment> Gross primary productivity is the rate of synthesis of biomass per unit area from inorganic precursors by autotrophs, especially by photosynthesising plants using sunlight for energy. The producers also respire some of this biomass and the difference is net_primary_producivity.

	<rdfs:comment>"Respiration carbon" refers to the rate at which biomass is respired expressed as the mass of carbon which it contains. Heterotrophic respiration is respiration by heterotrophs ("consumers"), which are organisms (including animals and decomposers) that consume other organisms or dead organic material, rather than synthesising organic material from inorganic precursors using energy from the environment (especially sunlight) as autotrophs ("producers") do.

	<rdfs:comment> "Content" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The "atmosphere content" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  "Emission" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). "Emission" is a process entirely distinct from "re-emission" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for benzene is C6H6.  Benzene is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and has a ring structure consisting of six carbon atoms joined by alternating single and double chemical bonds. Each carbon atom is additionally bonded to one hydrogen atom. There are standard names that refer to aromatic_compounds as a group, as well as those for individual species.</rdfs:comment>
