    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An IT service that is visible to the customer. These are normally
services that support the customerâ€™s business processes and facilitate one or
more outcomes desired by the customer. All live customer-facing services, including those available for deployment, are recorded in the service catalogue along with customer-visible information about deliverables, prices, contact points, ordering and request processes. Other information such as relationships to supporting services and other CIs will also be recorded for internal use by the IT service provider.
ITIL 2011 calls this "customer-facing service" while use Business Service as a more general term ( ITIL Business Service could be also a non IT )</rdfs:comment>
