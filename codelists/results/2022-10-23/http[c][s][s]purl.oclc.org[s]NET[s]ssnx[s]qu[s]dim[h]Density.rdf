    <rdfs:comment> 'Mass concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B containedin A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria.  The presence of chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis to take place.  There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally.  All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies.  The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms.  'Calcareous phytoplankton' are phytoplankton that produce calcite. Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label>mass concentration of diazotrophs expressed as chlorophyll in sea water</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment> 'Mass concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B containedin A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria.  The presence of chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis to take place.  There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally.  All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies.  The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. In ocean modelling, diazotrophs are phytoplankton of the phylum cyanobacteria distinct from other phytoplankton groups in their ability to fix nitrogen gas in addition to nitrate and ammonium. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label>mass concentration of miscellaneous phytoplankton expressed as chlorophyll in sea water</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment> 'Mass concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B containedin A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria.  The presence of chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis to take place.  There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally.  All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies.  The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms.  'Miscellaneous phytoplankton' are all those phytoplankton that are not diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous phytoplankton, picophytoplankton or other seperately named components of the phytoplankton population. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. "nmvoc" means non methane volatile organic compounds. "Anthropogenic" means influenced, caused, or created by human activity.
 The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. </rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label>reference sea water density for boussinesq approximation</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment> Sea water density is the in-situ density (not the potential density). For a rigid lid Boussinesq geopotential ocean model the density of the sea water is maintained at a constant reference density.  In a model using the rigid lid Boussinesq approximation , the vertical grid coordinates (and hence the grid cell volumes) are time invariant.</rdfs:comment>

"Clox" describes a family of chemical species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of  hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.   Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.</rdfs:comment>
