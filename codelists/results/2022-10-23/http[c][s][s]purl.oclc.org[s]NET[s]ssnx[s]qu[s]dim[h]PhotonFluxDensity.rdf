    <rdfs:label>sinking mole flux of aragonite expressed as carbon in sea water</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment> The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B,where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter within a body of water. Aragonite is a  mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of aragonite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for calcite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B,where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter within a body of water.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Content" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  "tendency_of_X" means derivative of X with respect to time.  Aragonite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of aragonite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for calcite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Downward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed downward (negative upward).  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. </rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Upward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward).  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.  The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.  Thechemical formula for dimethyl sulfide is (CH3)2S.  Dimethyl sulfide is sometimes referredto as DMS.</rdfs:comment>
